Talk Description
================

i've been v pessimistic lately! i started exploring dweb stuff 6 years ago because it felt utopian; we were going to make a better world with technology, and i knew how. but i don't anymore! the longer i work in this field, the less clear the path-to-world-improvement becomes, and the more clearly i see many ways we might instead degrade things for most people.

i hope i'm wrong. please tell me i'm wrong.

i'll walk you through my thoughts on how we might just further jam the spokes of civilization, and you tell me instead how we're actually greasing the chain.
